We can reverse-engineer the logic of the license key checking:

1. It should be started by the `key_part_static1_trial`
2. Then, followed by the hex digest character at certain positions.
3. Last, add closing curly brace.

The output of these steps is the flag. To confirm it, enter the flag and make sure that the `keygenme.py` file is created.

Flag: `picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_e584b363}`
